        "Exercise regularly: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities at least two days per week. Find activities that you enjoy, such as running, swimming, dancing, or weightlifting",
        "Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT): HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief periods of rest or active recovery. It can help you burn more calories and improve your cardiovascular fitness in less time than traditional steady-state cardio.",
        "Stretch regularly: Stretching can improve your flexibility, range of motion, and help prevent injury. Try incorporating a stretching routine before and after your workouts.",
        "Find an accountability partner: Having a workout buddy or partner can help keep you motivated and accountable. Consider joining a fitness class or finding a workout partner to help keep you on track.",
        "You can do the following: Include 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity most days. Cardiovascular activity is an essential part of any plan to improve physical fitness. Exercising for 150 minutes per week (or 30 minutes five days per week) is recommended, so try to make this amount of activity part of your schedule. As an alternative, you may do 75 minutes of vigorous cardiovascular activity. For example, you could do 15 minutes of kickboxing, stair climbing, or running five days out of every week. Keep in mind that exercising for longer is better. If you can fit in 300 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week, then you will gain more health benefits than if you exercise for 150 minutes per week.",
        "You can go for short walks around your neighborhood, sprint through 10-mile bike rides, or sweat it out at the gym.",
        "You can add strength training. Strength training is also essential for physical fitness, but you only need to do two strength training workouts each week. Make sure that these two workouts target all of your major muscle groups, including your abs, arms, back, chest, hips, legs, and shoulders. Both workout groups don't have to focus on all muscle groups at once. For example, one workout can focus on your arms, back, chest, and shoulders. The other workout can focus on your abs, hips, and legs.",
        "You can take a class. Exercise classes provide a good workout and a social outlet as well. Group exercise classes may also help you to stay motivated more than working out on your own. Try taking an exercise class such as: Spinning, Zumba, Step, Yoga, Tai chi, Pilates",
        "Find little ways to move more. Adding more small bursts of physical activity into your day may also help to improve your physical fitness levels. Even if you only have a few minutes, you can take advantage of this time and get a little extra physical activity into your day. For example, you could do some sit-ups during a commercial break, park your car further away from the entrance at the grocery store, or take the stairs instead of the elevator. All of these little changes will help to improve your cardiovascular health and build your strength.",
        "Set goals. Having a fitness goal or a series of little goals that you are working towards will help you to stay focused and may even help to keep you motivated. Make sure that you set goals that are SMART (specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-based). For example, if you want to exercise every day, you might set your goal as something like, 'I will go for a brisk 30-minute walk every morning this week.'",
        "Start small. Although it is rare, jumping right into vigorous exercise after being sedentary for a long time can increase your risk of having a heart attack; therefore, it is best to go slow and start with something less intense, such as walking, swimming, or biking. Starting slow will also help to reduce your chances of getting injured, which can put a hold on your fitness efforts. After a while, you can increase your activity intensity and duration, such as from walking to jogging, or biking on a flat surface to biking on a somewhat hilly surface, or swimming for 45 minutes instead of 30 minutes. Starting with small, more easily-achieved goals helps people stick with their plans. Drastic changes are harder to stick with — find something that you enjoy and seems doable.",
        "Consider working with a personal trainer. If you have a hard time staying motivated or if you just are not sure where to start, a trainer can help you. Working with a trainer can give your fitness efforts a good jump start and working with a trainer may also make it easier to stick with your program. A personal trainer can also teach you some effective workout strategies to keep you interested and seeing results. Some personal trainers will also provide you with meal plan ideas and advice about how to maximize your results."

        "The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet combines aspects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets to create an eating pattern that focuses on brain health. How it works: Like the flexitarian diet, the MIND diet does not have a strict meal plan, but instead encourages eating 10 specific foods with brain health benefits. Per week, MIND includes eating:- six or more servings of green, leafy vegetables - one serving of non-starchy vegetables - five or more servings of nuts - berries - beans - olive oil - whole grains - fish - poultry. Health benefits: Research shows that the MIND diet may reduce a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and studies show that the MIND diet is superior to other plant-rich diets for improving cognition. Research also shows that the MIND diet can help slow cognitive decline and improve resiliency in older adults. It may also help delay the onset of the movement disorder Parkinson's disease. However, more research needs to be done concerning the MIND diet and weight loss. Other benefits: By combining the best of two diets, the MIND diet has a lot to offer and offers some more flexibility than stricter diets. While you can eat more than the 10 food groups it recommends, the closer you stick to the diet, the better your results may be. Summary: The MIND diet combines aspects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets and may help reduce your risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. However, more research needs to be done to evaluate its ability to help you lose weight.",
        "Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular versions of plant-based diets, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons. However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet. This is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.",
        "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, is an eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure, which is clinically known as hypertension. It emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. It is low in salt, red meat, added sugars, and fat. While the DASH diet is not a weight loss diet, many people report losing weight on it.",
        "The Mediterranean diet has long been considered the gold standard for nutrition, disease prevention, wellness, and longevity. This is based on its nutrition benefits and sustainability. How it works: The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece have traditionally eaten. It is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, nuts, lentils, and olive oil. Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are to be eaten in moderation, and red meats are limited. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet limits refined grains, trans fat, processed meat, added sugar, and other highly processed foods. Health benefits: This diet’s emphasis on minimally processed foods and plants has been associated with a reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Studies also show that the Mediterranean diet has a preventive effect against certain cancers. Though the diet was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that its plant-based, high unsaturated fat dietary pattern can also aid in weight loss. A systematic review analyzing five different studies found that, compared with a low-fat diet, the Mediterranean diet resulted in greater weight loss after 1 year. Compared with a low-carb diet, it produced similar weight loss results. One study in more than 500 adults over 12 months found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with double the likelihood of weight loss maintenance. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, which may help combat inflammation and oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals. Other benefits: Recent studies have also found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased risk of mental disorders, including cognitive decline and depression. Eating less meat is also associated with a more sustainable diet for the planet. Downside: Since the Mediterranean diet does not put a big emphasis on dairy products, it’s important to make sure you still get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Summary: The Mediterranean diet emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, fish, and healthy oils while restricting refined and highly processed foods. While it’s not a weight loss diet, studies show that it can promote weight loss and overall health.",
        "The Intermittent Fasting : There are different approaches to intermittent fasting, with the most popular being an 8:16 split —  meaning you consume your calories in an eight-hour eating window and fast for the other 16 hours of the day. You can also do a 10:16, 16:10, or even 6:20 eating:fasting split. Some extremists go as far as squeezing a whole day’s worth of calories into a single hour.  The concept is that you’ll be eating fewer calories since you’re squeezing them into a narrower timeframe, as opposed to consuming them throughout the day.During the fasting period, you’re allowed zero-calorie beverages such as black coffee, herbal teas, and sparkling and flat water.Several studies have found that IF not only results in weight loss but can help improve insulin resistance, reduce oxidative stress on your cells, stabilize blood sugar levels, and reduce the risk of strokes.",
        "The Carnivore Diet devotees only eat animal-based products — meat, cheese, milk, animal-based fats, and eggs (though some variations only allow meat, no eggs, and dairy). There are no grains, no vegetables, and no fruits. No, that’s not a joke.Also known as the Zero Carb Diet, it’s basically a variation of the keto diet since it’s fat and protein is prioritized over carbs. This diet approach flies in the face of scientific research that proves that limiting your meat intake can extend your life and improve cardiovascular health. Still, its followers are have claimed it can fight inflammation and prevent nutrient deficiencies. There is proof that it can lead to weight loss, especially since protein increases the body’s thermic effect of feeding —the energy it takes to digest food.The scientific consensus, though, is that this diet may lead to an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, and overall risk of death because there are no fruits or vegetables in it",
        "The Paleo diet, sometimes called “The Caveman Diet,” could be considered a cousin of the carnivore diet. In addition to meat, you’re also eating fish, vegetables, fruit, nuts, and seeds. You need to avoid any grains, dairy, processed foods, beans, legumes, and sugars while adhering to this diet. Studies have shown that it’s effective in helping people lose weight, drop their blood pressure, and improve other blood markers.  Many researchers, though, point out there’s not enough evidence of the diet’s effects on health and that more research needs to be done. Others also warn against the diet’s exclusion of whole grains, which has been shown to ward off heart disease and diabetes. ",
        "The Low-carb diets, which involve limiting carb intake to 20–150 grams per day, have been popular for decades for weight loss, as they force the body to use more fats for fuel instead of carbs, and emphasize unlimited protein and fat intake; this leads to a reduction in appetite and calorie intake, and may benefit major disease risk factors such as blood triglycerides, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels; however, they do not suit everyone, and some may experience an increase in bad LDL cholesterol or, in rare cases, a serious condition called nondiabetic ketoacidosis.",
        "The Ketogenic Diet In recent years, the Ketogenic diet has arguably been one of the most discussed and debated diet. Even if you’re not a follower, you’ve no doubt seen specially designed keto snacks on store shelves for its devotees. But what is it? Keto, as it’s called for short, is a diet that prioritizes fat (65-75 percent of your daily calories), with moderate protein consumption (20-30 percent) and very few carbs (only about five percent, though some versions prohibit carbs altogether). Which means you’ll be eating a lot of avocados, eggs, and bunless cheeseburgers. The Keto diet was designed to keep the body in a near-constant state of ketosis, a metabolic state where the body creates ketones from fat to use as energy instead of sugar from carbs (the body’s primary and preferred energy source). There have also been claims it may help treat cancer and even respiratory illnesses. (8) As mentioned above, weight loss comes down to calories in vs. calories out. Several studies point out keto is no more effective for weight loss when calories are matched with other diets.", 
        "An ultra-low-fat diet restricts your consumption of fat to under 10% of daily calories.Generally, a low-fat diet provides around 30% of its calories as fat.Studies reveal that this diet is ineffective for weight loss in the long term.Proponents of the ultra-low-fat diet claim that traditional low-fat diets are not low enough in fat and that fat intake needs to stay under 10% of total calories to produce health benefits and weight loss.How it works: An ultra-low-fat diet contains 10% or fewer calories from fat. The diet is mostly plant-based and has a limited intake of animal products (66Trusted Source).Therefore, it’s generally very high in carbs — around 80% of calories — and low in protein — at 10% of calories.Weight loss: This diet has proven very successful for weight loss among obese individuals. In one study, obese individuals lost an average of 140 pounds (63 kg) on an ultra-low-fat diet (67Trusted Source).Another 8-week study with a diet containing 7–14% fat showed an average weight loss of 14.8 pounds (6.7 kg) (68Trusted Source).Other benefits: Studies suggest that ultra-low-fat diets can improve several risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and markers of inflammation (69Trusted Source, 70Trusted Source, 71, 72Trusted Source, 73Trusted Source, 74Trusted Source).Surprisingly, this high-carb, low-fat diet can also lead to significant improvements in type 2 diabetes (75Trusted Source, 76Trusted Source, 77Trusted Source, 78Trusted Source).Furthermore, it may slow the progression of multiple sclerosis — an autoimmune disease that affects your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves in the eyes (79Trusted Source, 80Trusted Source).The downside: The fat restriction may cause long-term problems, as fat plays many important roles in your body. These include helping build cell membranes and hormones, as well as helping your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins.Moreover, an ultra-low-fat diet limits intake of many healthy foods, lacks variety, and is extremely hard to stick to.SUMMARY An ultra-low-fat diet contains less than 10% of its calories from fat. It can cause significant weight loss and may also have impressive benefits for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.",
        "The Dukan diet is a high-protein, low-carb weight loss diet split into four phases — two weight loss phases and two maintenance phases. How long you stay in each phase depends on how much weight you need to lose. Each phase has its own dietary pattern.How it works: The weight loss phases are primarily based on eating unlimited high-protein foods and mandatory oat bran.The other phases involve adding non-starchy vegetables followed by some carbs and fat. Later on, there will be fewer and fewer pure protein days to maintain your new weight. Weight loss: In one study, women following the Dukan diet ate about 1,000 calories and 100 grams of protein per day and lost an average of 33 pounds (15 kg) in 8–10 weeks (51Trusted Source).Also, many other studies show that high-protein, low-carb diets may have major weight loss benefits (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source).These include a higher metabolic rate, a decrease in the hunger hormone ghrelin and an increase in several fullness hormones (56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source).Other benefits: Apart from weight loss, there are no recorded benefits of the Dukan diet in scientific literature.The downside: There is very little quality research available on the Dukan diet.The Dukan diet limits both fat and carbs — a strategy not based on science. On the contrary, consuming fat as part of a high-protein diet seems to increase metabolic rate compared to both low-carb and low-fat diets (60Trusted Source).What’s more, fast weight loss achieved by severe calorie restriction tends to cause significant muscle loss (61Trusted Source).The loss of muscle mass and severe calorie restriction may also cause your body to conserve energy, making it very easy to regain the weight after losing it (62Trusted Source, 63Trusted Source, 64Trusted Source, 65Trusted Source).SUMMARY The Dukan diet has not been tested in quality human studies. The diet may cause weight loss, but it also may slow down your metabolism and make you lose muscle mass along with fat mass.",
        "The Atkins diet is the most well-known low-carb weight loss diet.Its proponents insist that you can lose weight by eating as much protein and fat as you like, as long as you avoid carbs.The main reason why low-carb diets are so effective for weight loss is that they reduce your appetite.This causes you to eat fewer calories without having to think about it (32Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).How it works: The Atkins diet is split into four phases. It starts with an induction phase, during which you eat under 20 grams of carbs per day for two weeks.The other phases involve slowly reintroducing healthy carbs back into your diet as you approach your goal weight.Weight loss: The Atkins diet has been studied extensively and found to lead to faster weight loss than low-fat diets (52Trusted Source, 81Trusted Source).Other studies note that low-carb diets are very helpful for weight loss. They are especially successful in reducing belly fat, the most dangerous fat that lodges itself in your abdominal cavity (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).Other benefits: Numerous studies show that low-carb diets, like the Atkins diet, may reduce many risk factors for disease, including blood triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, insulin, and blood pressure (34Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source, 43, 44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source).Compared to other weight loss diets, low-carb diets also better improve blood sugar, “good” HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and other health markers (52Trusted Source, 81Trusted Source).The downside: As do other very low-carb diets, the Atkins diet is safe and healthy for most people but may cause problems in rare cases.",
        "The Zone Diet is a low-glycemic load diet that has you limit carbs to 35–45% of daily calories and protein and fat to 30% each (89Trusted Source).It recommends eating only carbs with a low glycemic index (GI).The GI of a food is an estimate of how much it raises your blood glucose levels after consumption.The Zone Diet was initially developed to reduce diet-induced inflammation, cause weight loss, and reduce your risk of chronic diseases (89Trusted Source).How it works: The Zone Diet recommends balancing each meal with 1/3 protein, 2/3 colorful fruits and veggies, and a dash of fat — namely monounsaturated oil, such as olive oil, avocado, or almonds.It also limits high-GI carbs, such as bananas, rice, and potatoes.Weight loss: Studies on low-GI diets are rather inconsistent. While some say that the diet promotes weight loss and reduces appetite, others show very little weight loss compared to other diets (90Trusted Source, 91Trusted Source, 92Trusted Source, 93Trusted Source).Other benefits: The greatest benefit of this diet is a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, such as reduced cholesterol and triglycerides (92Trusted Source, 94Trusted Source, 95Trusted Source, 96Trusted Source, 97Trusted Source).One study suggests that the Zone Diet may improve blood sugar control, reduce waist circumference, and lower chronic inflammation in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (98Trusted Source).The downside: One of the few drawbacks of this diet is that it limits the consumption of some healthy carb sources, such as bananas and potatoes.SUMMARY The Zone Diet is a low-GI diet. Studies on its weight loss benefits are inconsistent, but the diet improves many important health markers and reduces your risk of heart disease.",
        "The HCG diet is an extreme diet meant to cause very fast weight loss of up to 1–2 pounds (0.45–1 kg) per day.Its proponents claim that it boosts metabolism and fat loss without inducing hunger (82Trusted Source, 83Trusted Source).HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is a hormone present at high levels during early pregnancy.It tells a woman’s body it’s pregnant and maintains the production of hormones that are important for fetal development. It has also been used to treat fertility issues (84Trusted Source).How it works: The diet is split into three phases. During the first phase, you begin taking HCG supplements.During the second phase, you follow an ultra-low-calorie diet of only 500 calories per day, along with HCG supplement drops, pellets, injections, or sprays. The weight loss phase is prescribed for 3–6 weeks at a time.In the third phase, you stop taking HCG and slowly increase your food intake.Weight loss: The HCG diet does cause weight loss, but multiple studies conclude that the weight loss is due to the ultra-low-calorie diet alone — not the HCG hormone (82Trusted Source, 85Trusted Source, 86Trusted Source, 87Trusted Source).Furthermore, HCG was not found to reduce hunger.Other benefits: Aside from weight loss, there are no documented benefits of the HCG diet.The downside: Like most other ultra-low-calorie diets, the HCG diet may cause muscle loss, which results in a reduced ability to burn calories (61Trusted Source).Such severe calorie restriction further reduces the number of calories your body burns. This is because your body thinks it’s starving and therefore attempts to preserve energy (63Trusted Source).In addition, most HCG products on the market are scams and don’t contain any HCG. Only injections are able to raise blood levels of this hormone.Moreover, the diet has many side effects, including headaches, fatigue, and depression. There is also one report of a woman developing blood clots, most likely caused by the diet (83Trusted Source).The FDA disapproves of this diet, labeling it dangerous, illegal, and fraudulent (88Trusted Source).SUMMARY The HCG diet is a rapid weight loss diet. It’s not based on any scientific evidence and may reduce metabolic rate and cause muscle loss, headaches, fatigue, and depression.",
        "The Sirtfood Diet has grown in popularity in recent years. Created by nutritionists Aidan Goggins and Glen Matten, the diet focuses on foods high in sirtuins, a group of proteins found in the body that regulate metabolism. Foods high in sirts include red wine, dark chocolate, walnuts, Medjool dates, walnuts, arugula, coffee, capers, and extra-virgin olive oil. Following the Sirtfood Diet isn’t as simple as just eating those foods. Goggins and Matten prescribe a two-phase approach. In the first, you can only drink three sirtfood green juices and eat one full meal rich in sirtfoods, which amounts to 1,000 calories for three days. On days four to seven, your caloric intake goes up to 1,500. Then, in Phase two, you eat three sirtfood-rich meals per day and a green juice for two weeks. After that, you can either repeat that process or stick to a diet rich in sirts while continuing to drink at least one juice per day. The celebrity endorsements aside, there’s little proof that the specific diet works for weight loss or better health. One study found that mice with high sirt levels had more fat loss than other mice. (18) That said, no mention was made of total calories consumed or other notable weight-loss factors. So, it’s difficult to directly link more sirtuins to weight loss."
